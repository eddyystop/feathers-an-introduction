# Writing a chat room app

We've learned much about Feathers in Step by Step Into to Basic Feathers.
We've also seen how the generators help you structure your app.
And we've written some servers which do some interesting things.

We're going to build a real-time chat app with NeDB as the database.
It's a great way to cover all the things that you'd need to do in a real world application
and to see how Feathers can help.
It also makes a lot more sense to have a real-time component than a Todo list.

This is what we want it to look like:
