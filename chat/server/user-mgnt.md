# User management

Our server can only add, modify and delete user items.

We would typically want to verify a new user's email by sending a verification email.
We would also want to send notifications when an email address changes,
as well as handle forgotten passwords.

You can add these features to your own servers by including
[`features-authentication-management`](https://docs.feathersjs.com/v/auk/authentication/management.html).

## Is anything wrong, unclear, missing?
