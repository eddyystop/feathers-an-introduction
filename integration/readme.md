# Integration with Other Frameworks

In addition to Feathers, you are likely to use other frameworks and packages.
This guide reviews how to do that with the more popular products.

> **Adapters.** We are fortunate to have adapters for some of these frameworks,
and that makes working with them easy.

> **Write and share an adapter.** Write your own adapter for a framework which doesn't
have one, and then share it with everyone.
