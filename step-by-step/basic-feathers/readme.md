# Basic Feathers

Feathers **services** are the heart of every Feathers application.
They are small, data-oriented objects that can be used to perform CRUD operations on a resource.
A resource could be stored in a database, on another server or somewhere entirely different.

> **Services.** In this guide we'll use services as database connectors only.
That is not their only use in Feathers however.
The companion guide [Feathers Patterns](/patterns/readme.md) goes over some of the interesting things
they can used to implement:
dashboards, proxy server, remote procedure calls, and resource management on the client.
