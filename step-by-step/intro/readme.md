# Introduction

We will start with writing small segments of Feathers code by hand.
We'll take a step by step approach, introducing a few new concepts each time.

Each step is backed by a working example in the repo that comes with this guide.
The code samples in the guide are extracts from those examples.
This working code should reduce ambiguity and confusion.

Feathers has a definite **ah-ha** moment, when you realize how much it accomplishes and how simply.
We want to get to that moment quickly while fulling understanding what is happening.

We'll develop a solid enough understanding of Feathers basics that,
by the time we get to Feathers' generators,
we'll be mainly interested in how they organize projects.

## Our intended audience

Readers should have reasonable JavaScript experience, some experience with Node,
the concept of HTTP REST, and an idea of what websockets are.
We assume everyone has worked at least a bit with database tables.

This guide should be an comfortable introduction to Feathers for people learning new technologies,
such as those coming from PHP, Ruby or Meteor.

It may be productive for seasoned developers, experienced in Node, REST and websockets,
to skim the text, paying more attention to the code extracts.

They should however make sure to absorb fully the **Generators** section.
That should save them some time compared to putting together their own understanding of how projects are organized.
